Hello.
Lets start.

https://www.tekton.com/conversion-chart-card-apg40001

write namdom first and last name, and email.
pass reCaptcha.
and continue.

Random street address.
New York
10001
(909)322 3513

Now it says: "Credit card declined. Please verify your card details, billing address, and any limits on your card."
it means, the card is not valid.
mark it invalid.
close the message to try next one.
remove card to new one.

"Your card has insufficient funds."

this one is also invalid.

it succeeded and the card is valid.

like this, we have to check all cards.

There is a probleim.
When it gots invalid for 6 times, it will be banned.

In this case, we have to clear all site data
 such as cookie and storage data.
and start from the beginning again.

like this.
we have to check all cards and the automation app should
 result a valid card list.
Or mark all cards Invalid or Valid.
Checking all cards should be done automatically without stop.

Thats all.
Thanks.

I will provide you this text file.
